# :computer: Third-Party-APIs: Work Day Scheduler :computer:

I created a calendar application that  by modifying starter code. 

The goals of this project are:
* Allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm).
* Run in the browser. 
* Feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
  
  
## How is it looks?


## User Story

As an employer:
_AS AN employee with a busy schedule
<br>I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
<br>SO THAT I can manage my time effectively_

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop the portfolio :

* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner
* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
* THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
* WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
* THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a timeblock
* THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
* THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
* THEN the saved events persist
